Homework for the seven lesson

1. **task1** we created a class "CreditCard" with the fields "billNumber" and "billCurrentAmount".  
Next, we created one constructor with two parameters. In class "Services" we created three methods -
"replenish" for adding money to card, "withdraw" to withdraw money from card and "checkout" to show information
about the card. In class "Runner" we created three "CreditCard" objects and run test scenario:
- Show information about three cards;
- Add money to first two cards and withdraw money from the third card;
- Show information about three cards again.

3. **task2** we created a class "Student" to describe the students of our group.  
Class fields: name, surname, groupName, age, passNumber.
Next, we created class "Methods" with one method "showInfo". We use him to show all information about the student.
In "Runner", we created ten "Student" objects, move them to array "tmsC27Onl".
With for-each loop and method "showInfo" we display information about all students.
